# White Rabbit on general purpose FPGA boards (without the dedicated external oscillators)

Based on the original contribution by <a href="https://www.missinglinkelectronics.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MLE-Light-Rabbit-Presentation-at-13th-White-Rabbit-Workshop.pdf">Missing Link Electronics</a> at the 13th White Rabbit
Workshop at CERN in 2024 and with the help of Nikhef's <a href="https://www.nikhef.nl/~peterj/">Peter Jansweijer</a>
CLBv3 (found on <a href="https://gitlab.com/ohwr/project/wr-cores/-/tree/master/syn/clbv3_ref_design?ref_type=heads">the OHWR gitlab repository</a>), this project demonstrates a functional White Rabbit implementation
on the <a href="https://enjoy-digital-shop.myshopify.com/products/litex-acorn-baseboard-mini-sqrl-acorn-cle215">Acorn CLE215+</a> Artix7 FPGA.

## Synthesizing for the Acorn CLE215+

The patch applied to the White Rabbit PTP Core repository allowing to synthetsize the project for the Acorn
CLE215+ as well as the instructions are found in the <a href="patch/">patch</a> repository (tested with Xilinx Vivado 2022.2).

## PLL gain settings

From the shell connected to the embdded RISC-V processor, the main PLL gain coefficients (proportional and integral) are set using the command
```
pll gain 0 0 -400 -2 12
```

and similartly for the helper PLL (any negative number will do instead of -1 as 2nd argument)
```
pll gain -1 0 -400 -2 12
```

## Results


MDEV measurement as a function of PLL loop gain coefficients, changing Kp while
keeping Ki fixed (-2) except for two measurements, of the time interval between the 
White Rabbit Switche (WRS) and the CLE215+ 1-PPS outputs. For reference, WRS is the Modified 
Allan Deviation of the two PPS generated by two WRS (Creotech),
matching the expected value of about 60 ps jitter at 1 s integration time.

Beyond the long-term time-domain characteristics, the phase noise of a 10-MHz output
locked on the White Rabbit control signal is measurement as a function of control loop
parameters. Measurements performed using a Rohde & Schwarz FSWP 
Phase Noise Analyzer with 10-correlations in the 1-Hz bin.

All Modified Allan deviation plot exhibit a $1/\tau$ slope, i.e. $1/\tau^2$ for the variance,
characteristic of flicker phase noise. The MVAR of flicker PM [1] level is $0.0855 h_1/\tau^2$: at
1 Hz, the phase noise of $-70$ dBc/Hz or $-67$ dBrad $^2$ /Hz would lead to 
$\sqrt{10^{-6.7}/(10^7)^2\cdot 0.0855}=1.4\cdot 10^{-11}$. The observed $5.5\cdot 10^{-11}$ hints at a noise
model too simple to account for all contributions.

From this analysis, we conclude that "optimal" loop coefficients are **Kp=-400 and Ki=-80**.

The command ``pll stat`` must display something like
```
softpll: mode:3 seq:ready n_ref 1 n_out 1
irqs:400961 alignment_state:0 HL1 ML1 HY=25714 MY=42355 DelCnt=0 setpoint:17364 refcnt:209789 tagcnt:5
```
where HL1 means that the helper PLL is locked and ML1 means that the main PLL is 
locked.

# Application to the M2SDR

```
git clone https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex_wr_nic
cd litex_wr_nic
git checkout m2sdr
./m2sdr_wr_nic.py --build
openFPGALoader --fpga-part xc7a200tsbg484 --cable ft4232 --freq 20000000 --write-flash --bitstream litex_m2sdr_platform.bin
```
where we manually ``openFPGALoader`` rather than ``--flash`` to synthesize and flash on different computers.

Then for communicating between PC and M2SDR: either
```
bar=`lspci | grep Xil | cut -d\  -f1`
litex_server --pcie --pcie-bar $bar
```
and then 
```
litex_term crossover --csr-csv csr.csv
```
where ``csr.csv`` was found in the ``test/`` of ``litex_wr_nic`` after synthesis of the gateware, but the
resulting terminal can hardly display the ``gui`` output of the White Rabbit, so the preferred method is
to compile the ``litex_wr_nic/software/kernel`` modules and
```
sudo rmmod m2sdr        # in case it was loaded
sudo insmod liteuart.ko
sudo insmod litepcie.ko
minicom -D /dev/ttyLXU0
```
The WR clock output is measured using a frequency counter by adding in ``litex_wr_nic/m2sdr_wr_nic.py`` the signal ``self.comb += platform.request("sync_clk_in").eq(ClockSignal("wr"))``
as the last instruction of the ``__init()__`` function just before the ``main():``, after commenting ``platform.request("pps_out").eq(pps),`` to avoid a conflict on the SYNCDBG_CLK pin.

When loading a new gateware, the PCI board must be enumerated again using ``echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/rescan``
